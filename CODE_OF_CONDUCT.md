# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our
project and our community a safe, inclusive, and welcoming experience for everyone.
We are committed to fostering an open and respectful environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of derogatory language or slurs.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses,
  without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and
are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of
unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the
project or community include using the project's official social media accounts, posting
via an official email address, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting the project team at [djahmadfire@gmail.com](mailto:djahmadfire@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to
the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be
posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's
leadership.
